## Prepare for logs

### 📌 Task Configure the service pipelines

Apply what you have learnt and configure a new service pipeline for logs.

You can find <mark>**otel-collector-config.yaml** </mark> in the directory

```
collector/otel-collector-config.yaml
```

Scroll down to the section called `service` and make the necessary modifications. Be careful of the spaces as yaml files are sensitive to the spaces.

  ```yaml
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug, otlphttp]
  ```

</details>

### ✅ Verify results

```bash
docker logs opentelemetry-collector 2>&1 | grep -i logs
```

```bash
